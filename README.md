Rust GTD App
===================================================

GTD (Getting Things Done) is a form of task management that really reasonates with me, for the most part.
Since there are aspects to the pattern that I want to customize a bit, I decided to try to learn more
Rust and webassembly while working towards figuring out exactly what works best for me WRT GTD.
